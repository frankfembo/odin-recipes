<h2 class="blue-text">Sweet Corn Rings</h2>
<p>I love corn on the cob, but this fun little twist might be my new favorite way to make it more scrumptious.</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<p>You will need the following ingredients to prepare;</p>
<ul class="text">
	<li>0.25 cup unsalted butter.</li>
	<li>0.5 teaspoon each, 'garlic, chili, and onion powder'.</li>
	<li>0.5 teaspoon Cajun powder.</li>
	<li>2 ears fresh corn, sliced into 6 equal-sized rings.</li>
	<li>Sea salt to taste.</li>
	<li>2 teaspoon chopped fresh chives.</li>
	<li>0.25 cup ranch dressing, or to taste.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
<ol class="text">
	<li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
	<li>Combine butter, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and Cajun seasoning in a microwave-safe dish and cook in the microwave until butter is fully melted, about 1 minute. Remove from microwave and stir.</li>
	<li>Use tongs to dip a corn ring intoo the spiced butter, making sure to coat it thoroughly in the spices. Transfer to a plate and continue until all of the rings have been dipped. There will be butter remaining.</li>
	<li>Heat an oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Once heated, place corn rings into the skillet, season them individually with sea salt, and let them sizzle away until a nice sear has developed, about 3 minutes. Flip and use a basting brush to brush remaining butter onto the seared sides of the rings. season again with salt and continue to cook for 2 more minutes.</li>
	<li>Transfer the skilllet into the preheated oven and cook for 10 minutes, carefuly flip the rings and cook for 5 more minutes.</li>
	<li>Remove from the oven and transfer to a serving platter. Sprinkle chives over top and serve with ranch dressing, along with corn skewers for picking up individual rings.</li>
